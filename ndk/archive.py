# For (un)zipping archives on Unix-like systems, the "zip" and "unzip" commands
# are pretty universally available.
#
# For Windows, the situation is more complicated. After trying and rejecting
# several options, the somewhat surprising best choice is the "tar"
# command, which is available in Windows since 2018:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20171219-tar-and-curl-come-to-windows
# Note that this is bsdtar, which has slightly different command-line flags
# than GNU tar.
#
# For the record, here are other options, and why they didn't work:
#
# - Python's built-in shutil.unpack_archive uses the "zipfile" module, which
#   does not restore permissions, including the executable bit, when
#   unzipping. https://bugs.python.org/issue15795
#
# - 7-zip is popular and works on a wide range of Windows versions,
#   but it is not guaranteed to be available, and is, in fact, not
#   available on our Windows build machines.
#
# - Expand-Archive in PowerShell results in modification times in the future
#   for NDK .zip files, possibly due to not handling time zones correctly.
