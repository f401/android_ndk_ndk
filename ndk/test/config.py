class TestConfig:
    """Describes the status of a test.

    Each test directory can contain a "test_config.py" file that describes
    the configurations a test is not expected to pass for. Previously this
    information could be captured in one of two places: the Application.mk
    file, or a BROKEN_BUILD/BROKEN_RUN file.

    Application.mk was used to state that a test was only to be run for a
    specific platform version, specific toolchain, or a set of ABIs.
    Unfortunately Application.mk could only specify a single toolchain or
    platform, not a set.

    BROKEN_BUILD/BROKEN_RUN files were too general. An empty file meant the
    test should always be skipped regardless of configuration. Any change that
    would put a test in that situation should be reverted immediately. These
    also didn't make it clear if the test was actually broken (and thus should
    be fixed) or just not applicable.

    A test_config.py file is more flexible. It is a Python module that defines
    at least one function by the same name as one in TestConfig.NullTestConfig.
    If a function is not defined the null implementation (not broken,
    supported), will be used.

            public bug (http://b.android.com/BUG_NUMBER).
