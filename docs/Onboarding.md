# Onboarding

The latest version of this document is available at
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/docs/Onboarding.md.

Welcome to the Android NDK! This guide will explain how to get started working
on the NDK (if you want to work *with* the NDK, see the [user
documentation](https://github.com/android/ndk/discussions)).

Googlers: you'll also want to refer to
[go/ndk-onboarding](http://go/ndk-onboarding) which will describe any details
not relevant to external contributors. Non-Googlers, don't worry, you're not
missing anything interesting, just boring things like instructions for how to
work our release tooling.
