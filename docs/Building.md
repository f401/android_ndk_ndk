# Building the NDK

The latest version of this document is available at
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/docs/Building.md.

Both Linux and Windows NDKs are built on Linux machines. Windows host binaries
are cross-compiled with MinGW.

Building the NDK for Mac OS X requires at least 10.13.

## Prerequisites

The first thing you need is the AOSP NDK repository. If you're new to using repo
and gerrit, see [repo.md](repo.md) for tips. If you're already familiar with how
to use repo and gerrit from other Android projects, you already know plenty :)

Check out the branch `master-ndk`. Do this in a new directory.

```bash
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b master-ndk

# Googlers, follow http://go/repo-init/master-ndk (select AOSP in the Host menu,
# and uncheck the box for the git superproject). At time of writing, the correct
# invocation is:
repo init -u \
    sso://android.git.corp.google.com/platform/manifest -b master-ndk
```

If you wish to rebuild a given release of the NDK, the release branches can also
be checked out. They're named `ndk-release-r${RELEASE}` for newer releases, but
`ndk-r{RELEASE}-release` for older releases. For example, to check out the r19
release branch, use the `-b ndk-release-r19` flag instad of `-b master-ndk`.

Linux dependencies are listed in the [Dockerfile]. You can use docker to build
the NDK:

```bash
docker build -t ndk-dev infra/docker
docker run -it -u $UID -v `realpath ..`:/src -w /src/ndk ndk-dev ./checkbuild.py
```

Building on Mac OS X has similar dependencies as Linux, but also requires Xcode.

Running tests requires that `adb` is in your `PATH`. This is provided as part of
the [Android SDK].

## Python environment setup

To set up your environment to use the correct versions of Python and Python
packages, install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and then do the
following.

Whenever you set up a new NDK tree (after a fresh `repo init`, for example),
configure the project to use our prebuilt Python instead of your system's. If on
Mac, be sure to use the darwin-x86 version instead.

```bash
poetry env use ../prebuilts/python/linux-x86/bin/python3
```

The first time, and also anytime you sync because there might be new or updated
dependencies, install the NDK dependencies to the virtualenv managed by poetry.

```bash
poetry install
```

Spawn a new shell using the virtualenv that Poetry created. You could instead
run NDK commands with the `poetry run` prefix (e.g. `poetry run
./checkbuild.py`), but it's simpler to just spawn a new shell. Plus, if it's in
your environment your editor can use it.

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Build

### For Linux or Darwin

```bash
$ python checkbuild.py
```

If you get an error like the following:

```
Expected python to be $NDK_SRC/prebuilts/python/$HOST/bin/python3.9, but is ~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/$VENV/bin/python (/usr/bin/python3.9).
```

Your Poetry virualenv was misconfigured. It seems that `poetry env use` will not
replace an existing virtualenv of the same major/minor version, so if you ran
any poetry commands before `poetry env use`, your environment needs to be
deleted and recreated.

```bash
$ poetry env remove $VENV
$ poetry env use ../prebuilts/python/linux-x86/bin/python3
$ poetry install
```

If you get an error like the following:

```
Expected python to be $NDK_SRC/prebuilts/python/linux-x86/bin/python3.9, but is /usr/bin/python (/usr/bin/python3.9).
```

You ran checkbuild.py outside the poetry environment. Ensure that you've done
the first time setup (`poetry env use` and `poetry install`, as above), then
either run `poetry shell` to enter a new shell with the correct environment, or
use `poetry run checkbuild.py`.

If you get errors from the pythonlint task but it appears to only affect your
machine, one of the linters you have installed is probably not the correct
version. Run `poetry install` to sync your environment with the expected
versions.

### For Windows, from Linux

```bash
$ python checkbuild.py --system windows64
```

`checkbuild.py` will also build all of the NDK tests. This takes about 3x as
long as building the NDK itself, so pass `--no-build-tests` to skip building the
tests if you're iterating on build behavior or plan to rebuild only specific
tests. Tests can be built later with `python run_tests.py --rebuild`.

Note: The NDK's build and test scripts are implemented in Python 3 (currently
3.9). `checkbuild.py` will use a prebuilt Python, but `run_tests.py` does not do
this yet. `run_tests.py` also can be run outside of a complete development
environment (as it is when it is run on Windows), so a Python 3.9 virtualenv is
recommended.

## Packaging

Packaging uses `zip -9` so is extremely time consuming and disabled by default.
Use the `--package` flag to force packaging locally. This is not required for
local development and only needs to be used when testing packaging behavior.
